## Background

Hello everyone, I am John Chever.

The GSoC application has came to an end. In the process of communicating with the selected GSoC candidates, I found that people are generally afraid of video conversations with foreign tutors, so I invited my speaking tutor to give you a speaking lecture.

### About the number of words in the dictionary

For students with a small vocabulary (e.g., less than 8,000), it is recommended to memorize word books and not to read dictionaries, because you need to prioritize learning common words and should not be overwhelmed by out-of-the-way words.
At the same time, it is difficult for students with a small vocabulary to distinguish which words are commonly used and which words are not, and it is difficult to get a complete dictionary to skip reading.

### About Chinese-English / English-English dictionaries

For those who have enough time and wish to improve their English in all aspects (including speaking and writing), we recommend using a Chinese-English dictionary. Bump in the definition
It's very helpful to look up words you don't know, so you can expand your vocabulary in a tree. The words used in the definitions are related, so they often
It is also useful to accumulate synonyms and similar words.

If you have a vocabulary of more than 10,000 words, it is also recommended to use an English-English dictionary.

For students with a limited foundation and a small vocabulary, we recommend using a Chinese-English dictionary or word book to improve efficiency and prioritize the accumulation of basic vocabulary.

This course uses English-English dictionaries.

### About the word book

For students who are short of time, you can also choose a word book to memorize

About British/American dictionaries For personal reasons and for the background of the people in the course, we mainly use American dictionaries.
One of the advantages of the British dictionary is that the phonetic symbols are IPA, which I think is much better. But fortunately, the American dictionary is relatively easy to understand with its self-created phonetic symbols.
It won't take long to learn it specifically, and we will take you through it in class.
